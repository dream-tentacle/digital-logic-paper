This is the final project report of the course Digital Design and Computer
Organization. You can just downlaod the pdf to read the report.

In this project, I designed a simple RISC-V computer system on FPGA. The FPAG board
is Digilent Nexys A7-100T. The compter system is composed of: a CPU, a data memory,
an instruction memory, a vga screen, a keyboard, and a PWM audio output. The CPU is a
5-stage pipeline processor, which can execute 32-bit RISC-V instructions. The system
interface is a terminal, which can execute basic commands and run two software -
Snake and Piano.
